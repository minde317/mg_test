Hi Michael,
Regarding to Delivery 90593350 (INC1570161) 
 
[?28/?01/?2021 15:20]  
Could you explain situation what you did and why this delivery was deleted? 
We want to understand whether the issue still exist for packing. Or We can close an incident INC1570161  ? 
 
[?28/?01/?2021 15:37]  Sheehy, Michael:  
Hi Mindaugas, I picked the order with no difficulties, but when Martin Pollis attempted to serialise it 
some of the serial nos were attached to a previous DN and could not be serialised. 
On instruction from a supervisor I returned all 60 packs to location 303 from the 916 pick and pack location 
and attempted to create a new transfer order for this DN, but it could not be created 
and the only way to make sure the order went out was for customer success to cancel it and create a new order.
 
[?28/?01/?2021 15:39]  
could you tell the new delivery number?
 
[?28/?01/?2021 15:40]  
Does it mean we can close the incident INC1570161  (raised by Odhran Esdale)?
 
[?28/?01/?2021 15:42]  Sheehy, Michael:  
The new number was DN90595850 
I don't know if you can close the incident. Maybe check with Odhran
